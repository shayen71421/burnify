# Burnify üéØ

### Project Description
Burnify is a fun image-based tool that analyzes the darkness of toast from a photo and gives it a quirky rating ‚Äî from ‚ÄúLightly Kissed‚Äù to ‚ÄúFully Carbonized.‚Äù It uses computer vision to measure toastiness with humor.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People worldwide suffer from the eternal dilemma: Is my toast undercooked or just perfect? Without a universal toastiness standard, breakfasts are plagued by uncertainty, awkward debates, and slightly disappointing crunch levels. Burnify exists to end this crisis once and for all.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Burnify swoops in like your breakfast superhero ‚Äî armed with computer vision and a sharp sense of humor! Snap a pic of your toast, and Burnify‚Äôs cheeky algorithm scans every crumb to deliver an honest, hilarious toastiness verdict. No more guessing games or morning arguments ‚Äî just pure, toasted truth served with a side of laughs. Because let‚Äôs face it, your toast deserves a rating as crispy as it is clever!

- Python
- Flask
